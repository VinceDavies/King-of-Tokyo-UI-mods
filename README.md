# King-of-Tokyo-UI-mods

This project uses the script file in the chrome extension "Stylus" to reconfigure the user interface on the board game "King of Tokyo" which is hosted on boardgamearena.com. 

The mods allow for easier readability of the cards and larger font sizes and less empty space. What each line of code does is commented on, feel free to tweak this more to your fitting.
